## üöÄ **Quick Start Guide**

### **Option 1: AI-Guided Investigation (Recommended for Beginners)**

```python
from forensics_agent import root_agent

# Start an interactive forensics investigation
agent = root_agent
response = agent.chat("I need to investigate a potential security breach on this Linux system. Please guide me through a comprehensive forensics analysis.")

# The agent will:
# 1. Explain the investigation methodology
# 2. Guide you through each phase step-by-step
# 3. Execute commands safely and explain findings
# 4. Generate a professional forensics report
```

### **Option 2: Automated Full Investigation**

```bash
# Run complete automated forensics collection
sudo ./forensics_automation.sh /mnt/evidence

# This will:
# - Install required forensics tools
# - Collect evidence across 13 phases
# - Generate comprehensive reports
# - Create tamper-evident evidence packages
```

### **Option 3: Manual Investigation with Guide**

```bash
# Follow the step-by-step methodology
cat forensics_process.md

# Execute commands from each phase as needed
# Perfect for learning and custom investigations
```
